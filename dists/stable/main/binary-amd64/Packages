Description: ArikeDB is a real-time database intended to be simple of use and fast
  runtime for high data availability and performance. The server is written completely in rust
  language, taking advantage of its robustness, efficiency and high performance. The current version of
  ArikeDB available for installation is still a beta, it is stable and all the features are tested,
  but we don't recommend using it in a production environment yet until the first official version gets released.
